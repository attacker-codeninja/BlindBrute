### TODO: 
# allow users to specify the http method with url based requests
# clean up url logic
# make it async with asyncio (oof)
# allow a user to pass in a wordlist instead of extracting characters
# allow users to specify binary ascii search (might be faster) or char based search
# add a flag to determine column length if the user desires it
# look into quantitative linguistics to optimize extraction
# update readme
# update requirements
# actually test the script
# probably a bunch of other shit
